# Assignment Reflection
In this assignment, I focused on practicing basic list operations in Python. Hereâ€™s how I approached the task:

## Understanding Requirements:
I carefully read the assignment instructions to understand the specific list operations that needed to be implemented.

## Setting Up the Environment: 
I created a new Python script file in my project directory to write the code. I ensured that I had Python installed and set up on my machine.

## Implementing List Operations:

I started by creating an empty list called my_list.
I used the append() method to add the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.
To insert the value 15 at the second position, I utilized the insert() method.
I extended my_list with another list [50, 60, 70] using the extend() method.
I removed the last element from the list using the pop() method.
To sort the list in ascending order, I applied the sort() method.
Finally, I found the index of the value 30 using the index() method and printed it to the console.
Testing the Code: After implementing the operations, I ran the script to ensure that it worked as expected. I verified that the output correctly displayed the index of the value 30.

## Documentation: 
I created a README file to document the project, 
including an overview of the code functionality

Overall, this assignment helped me reinforce my understanding of list operations in Python and improved my coding skills.
